# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Machine-Learning

Machine learning (ML) methods are of great importance when applied interdisciplinarily. As in many fields, ML methods also provide cost and time savings in medical applications. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques for breast cancer classification. We attempted to use various machine learning methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) both independently and in conjunction with dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA). Our analysis includes comparing the results obtained when all features are used as input, and examining the impact of PCA and NCA on classification performance. When several ML models were analyzed, KNN achieved a best training score of 0.99, a test score of 0.99 and a train score of 1.0. Other machine learning methods also demonstrated successful performance.
